# MDyn: Accelerated Modal Dynamics Solver
MDyn is a fast modal superposition analysis software highly vectorised in Python to solve structural dynamics problems involving wind, earthquakes, pedestrians, vehicles, trains, ... and their interaction. It can also calculate transfer functions (receptance) of structures and obtain influence lines from static moving loads.

It was created by Alfredo Camara, and contributions from you are welcome. If you are interested please contact here: alfredo.camara@upm.es

## Getting Started
The running codes are fully commented and should be easy to navigate. You can find video tutorials on MDyn from this link: 

https://drive.upm.es/s/TCAQFLkZlWqW1zM

More tutorials are on the way.

## Instalation
No instalation is needed (beyond some standard Python libraries like numpy, scipy, matplotlib). The subfolder "code" needs to be in the parent directory when running the main python script in the working sub-directory, as it is structured here.

## Accompanying Papers
Please refer to the paper (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advengsoft.2020.102934) for details of the MDyn solver, validation, and more information about the library.

Details about the use of MDyn to solve pedestrian-induced vibrations in footbridges are included in this paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.istruc.2024.106263.

Information on the use of MDyn coupled with image processing of CCTV in bridges to obtain the response of bridges under real traffic is included in this paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2024.118653.

The use of MDyn with microsimulated traffic flows is presented in this paper: https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219455425502608.

The use of MDyn to simulate the wind-vehicle-bridge interaction under skew winds is described in this paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jweia.2021.104672.
